# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

This project is all about minting your own NFTs, make them playable characters in your game, and let users earn your own crypto as they win games

The goal of this game will be to destroy a boss. Let's say that boss has 1,000,000 HP. What players do is when they start the game, they mint a character NFT that has a certain amount of Attack Damage and HP. Players can order their character NFT to attack the boss and deal damage to it. Kinda like a Pokemon!
The goal? Players need to work together to attack the boss and bring its HP down to 0. The catch? Every time a player hit the boss, the boss hits the player back! If the NFT's HP goes below 0, the player's NFT dies and they can't hit the boss anymore. Players can only have one character NFT in their wallet. Once the character's NFT dies, it's game over. That means many players need to join forces to attack the boss and kill it.
The important thing to know here is that the characters themselves are NFTs.
So, when a player goes to play the game:
They'll connect their wallet.
The game will detect they don't have a character NFT in their wallet.
And let them choose a character and mint their own character NFT to play the game. Each character NFT has its own attributes stored on the NFT directly like: HP, Attack Damage, the image of the character, etc. So, when the character's HP hits 0, it would say hp: 0 on the NFT itself.

# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

This project is all about DAI staking
whereby, the user receives AyaaToken as a reward for staking DAI in the contract.
Further, the user can purchase a ayaa NFT through the NFT factory named Boi.
The AyaaTokens are sent to a lottery pool inside the Lottery contract.
Finally, each NFT includes a tokenId which acts as a lottery ticket.
The lottery feature uses Chainlink's VRF to provide a verifiably random number. The winner receives the contents of the lottery pool.
